Enhanced Object Detection in Snowy Scenes viaAdaptive Restoration-Assisted Learning and Large Kernel Refinement

## Official Pytorch implementation of ["Enhanced Object Detection in Snowy Scenes via Adaptive Restoration-Assisted Learning and Large Kernel Refinement"]

## Abstract
> Object detection in snowy weather poses significant challenges due to degraded image quality and obscured features. This paper introduces a unified detection framework that integrates image restoration tasks with object detection to mitigate weather interference. The proposed model consists of an Adaptive Multi-Level Feature Restoration (AMR) Branch for noise suppression, a Large Kernel Refinement (LKR) Module for cross-task integration, and a Cross-Scale Feature Integration (CFI) Module for feature aggregation. A large-scale snowy weather image dataset, srSnow, is constructed to support training and testing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves mean Average Precision (mAP) improvements of 3.80, 2.10, and 1.86 percentage points on the rSnow, RSOD, and Snowy-weather real-world datasets, respectively, validating its effectiveness in snowy weather object detection.
